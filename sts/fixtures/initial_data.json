Until she died forty years later, she was my teacher. Nevertheless, she remains a mystery to me. I cannot say that I knew her. If it is true that we cannot see above the level of our own being, then I could see only a fraction of who she really was. In preparing this article, I reviewed videotapes and notes of many meetings with her. It is clear now that we understood only part of what she said then. We were helped, and felt grateful, but we took in only what our little cups could hold<i>\u2014</i>and they were filled to overflowing. But it was often only much later, when we had more experience, that we could understand what she was giving us. I am still learning from her.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>We need to know our subjectivity if we want to become available to another kind of experience. My observation is one thing, but to begin to recognize myself as a cosmic unit is more important. Usually there is a block. My relationship to others is cut.</p><p>The primary question is \u2018What do I serve?\u2019 I need to be hungry for a right connection with what is highest in me and what is highest in the Universe; so I have to see what the connections are. My inner sensations are a hint.</p><p>How are we to realize that work is not for what is most delightful, but for <i>being</i>. The change is not a change in dream states, but in being\u2014a change in the harmonious balance which will affect the whole being.</p><p>I am dual, and it is true that sometimes I am one, and sometimes another. One part wishes to work and the other does not, but sometimes there is a sharp recognition that these two parts operate with their backs to one another. How to look and make an effort of presence to the existence of both?</p><p>If I function in the ordinary way, at the same rate of vibration, nothing will change. As long as my body is agitated I cannot experience the quiet that makes me aware of something deeper in myself. That is, I cannot receive higher impressions.</p><p>Mrs. Welch brought out the best in us. In her presence we would find that someone we thought of as arrogant, thoughtless, and insensitive would sometimes open up and bring the most moving and sensitive observations. We could not help but be touched, and to begin to look at our peers in a completely new way\u2014full of wonder \u2026 until we forgot.</p><p>It seemed during periods of intensive work that she held us all, individually and collectively, in her attention. It was as if we were all imbued with a finer substance and began to vibrate at a quicker tempo. In those conditions, all aspects of our human nature were magnified.</p><p>What she said seemed to be very important, and it was not only in her words, but also in her tone of voice. She spoke with authority and compassion, and what she said had the ring of truth. All of her outward manifestations seemed to emanate from a central core of being\u2014of presence.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>Under the instruction of someone who knows, we try to remember ourselves by learning how to collect attention. We try to still any outer movements, we quiet the body. We begin to study where our attention has been caught in order to free it\u2014free it from where it is caught in physical tension, in anxiety, in the constant flow of random thoughts. We try to draw together this fragmented substance we need for our work. Our work is in the direction of self-remembering\u2014remembering the self as a whole. What I am going toward is the central feeling of myself: I am. I exist.</p><p>Without attention I do not exist. Always my attention is taken\u2014by anything, by everything. It is taken. But it can be free. Collect attention, work for attention, learn to place your attention. When I make a serious effort to place my attention somewhere, relaxation begins, energies begin to take their correct place. The way begins to be opened for something other to appear.</p><p></p><embed alt=\"drWelchMrsWelch.jpg\" embedtype=\"image\" format=\"right\" id=\"1\"/><p>Although it is possible to record many of the things she said, that is very different from her direct, oral communication. <a href=\"http://www.gurdjieff.org/welchdr.htm\">Dr. William J. Welch</a>, Mrs. Welch\u2019s husband, once said that if books alone could convey understanding, all the bookcases would be enlightened!</p><p>Both she and Dr. Welch were full of good humour, and there was always much laughter at our meetings. The Welches were serious, but not solemn or heavy, and when anyone spoke they turned the full light of their attention on that person. In replying to a question someone raised, Dr. Welch said the following:</p><p>It is necessary to be in touch with the preoccupations that prevent one from seeing. When I look at you, what is it that stands in the way of my seeing you? I am not there, I am preoccupied. While you are talking, I\u2019m thinking of my answers\u2014all that material\u2014and I\u2019m not listening, and I\u2019m not aware that my attention is everywhere but on you. As a beginning, it\u2019s an exercise in bringing my attention on you\u2014really on you\u2014right now. If I have a question about this, as I do now, and if you have a question, and if I stay with it, and you stay with it, we have an exchange that is almost permanent. That experience is almost eternal. If I can attend to you, and you can attend to me, something takes place that is joyful, and new, and nourishing, and alive.</p><p>Until Dr. Welch retired, we did not see him often in Toronto. It was Mrs. Welch who came almost every month from 1955 through to the late 1980s. We were her group. It was as if she planted seeds here and nurtured them for a long time, hoping that something would grow and begin to have its own life.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>We all have moments of being awake, but we lose them quickly because we don\u2019t value them. Something takes place, but it is out of my control. Something does pierce this shell. How can I know my way to it? If you want to know what this piercing effort is\u2014it is my wish. There are moments when my wish can cut right through the protective armour and touch something real and authentic. Why are we not here\u2014right now? It can happen in the twinkling of an eye.</p><p>When Dr. Welch started to come to Toronto, we began to appreciate how beautifully he and Mrs. Welch complemented one another, and so now it is not possible for me to write about Mrs. Welch without also writing about Dr. Welch. Speaking to our group in Toronto, Dr. Welch said:</p><p>We are always looking in the wrong place for purpose, for meaning. We are heavy-laden with this big, blind automaton. Only in moments when our functioning is slowed down does the unengaged purpose appear. What is our life for? What in <i>hell</i> are we doing here?</p><p>Mrs. Welch gently added, \u201cWhat in <i>heaven\u2019s name</i> are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>One weekend when they were unable to come to Toronto, I was speaking to them both on the telephone. Mrs. Welch made me promise to give her love to <i>everyone</i>. She repeated this injunction. Then Dr. Welch\u2019s deep voice full of humour said, \u201cIn my case, you can be more discriminating.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Welch had a wonderful sense of humour, and a rapier wit. He and Mrs. Welch were being driven to our Group house in Toronto, via Bay Street, a route we had never taken before. At a certain point Mrs. Welch said, \u201cOh look, Bill. They have a Temperance Street in Toronto.\u201d Dr. Welch looked about and said, \u201cYes, but you\u2019ll notice they keep it at Bay!\u201d</p><p>Most of us felt that Dr. Welch challenged us, and Mrs. Welch affirmed us, but they had both been through all the grindstones. Often it was Mrs. Welch who challenged. Yet there was from both of them an affirmation of what was best in us.</p><p>When Mrs. Welch first invited me to take responsibility for a group, she said, \u201cThis is work for <i>you</i>. You cannot help anyone. Try to see your lying.\u201d Later I told her that I felt I was not able to carry this responsibility, but she told me this feeling was, in fact, almost a requirement of anyone who leads groups! \u201cBut, I feel entirely inadequate! What is my work here?\u201d</p><p>Listen to the group. Practise listening. Listen to yourself, and suffer how you are. It is your work. When you begin to awaken, the first thing you will see is your sleep. As you begin to see your mechanicality, your reactions, they begin to have less power. Seeing is our work.</p><p>\u201cBut the people in the group also see my reactions, my faults, and this cannot be helpful to them.\u201d She then said, \u201cMr. Gurdjieff never hid his faults.\u201d I continue to ponder this response.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><embed alt=\"louiseWelch.jpg\" embedtype=\"image\" format=\"right\" id=\"2\"/><p></p><p>In order to be useful to anyone, I have to <i>be</i>. Otherwise I am just a reacting mechanism, a played instrument.</p><p>Before you can be <i>more</i>, you must be what you are. Being is how I am, the relation of the different parts held together by my awareness. Completed man is \u2018in the image of God.\u2019 We are incomplete. In us the centres are either mixed or confused, not blended. If we wish to go in the direction of being completely human, we must begin to see why we are not.</p><p>I do not know the life of my body \u2026 nor do I know the life of my feelings, nor my intellect, and I know even less about something much higher that also exists in me\u2014although we have all had tastes of it. I am here to live not only in heaven, but also in my earthly part. Work first to see these two natures.</p><p>The ego has strength. It has acted as a lookout for a long time, and has looked after me well. It is self-preservation personified, but self-preservation of the small self. Now the ego begins to interfere with the growth of the Self.</p><p>If I try to control, I succeed only in repression. All my life I react. I must not try to suppress my reactions, not pretend they don\u2019t exist, not cover them with hypocrisy. I\u00a0must know myself at that moment, and not run away. The first step is to pay attention to the reaction. When we see, something changes because of this light.</p><p>We are all stronger than we think we are, but not stronger than we imagine we are. I\u00a0pretend that I am strong, which isn\u2019t true, but the feeling that I cannot, is not true either. Where is my area of choice? It is in the effort of being more attentive, more interested\u2014of giving an objective look at what is going on, <i>while</i> it is going on. This is what I wish\u2014it is a moment of awareness while I am experiencing. The experience is not separate, but it is difficult to talk about it in any other way. It is so simple. It is just being here. Just being.</p><p>For a long time, I measure everything I see in myself against an image of what I think I <i>should</i> be. It is impossible to see from there. If I do see something, I immediately want to change it. I do not want to be like that, and so I do not stay with what I have seen. I must develop the courage to stay with that. Do I really wish to be free, or only to avoid glimpses of my slavery?</p><p>Dr. Welch never hesitated to let the air out of our inflated expressions. A very serious and relatively senior member of our group said, \u201cAll my life I have given to others!\u201d Dr. Welch said, \u201cYou have never given anyone anything. Always others have taken from you.\u201d It was a piercing insight, and the person who had spoken immediately saw that it was true.</p><p>Mrs. Welch especially encouraged us to see the positive side of things. For example, if we began to see our lack of gratitude, we would be full of regret, but she helped us to see that, paradoxically, we were never so close to feeling real gratitude as when we saw our ingratitude. She also shepherded us away from taking ourselves too seriously. As always, Dr. Welch used other means to help us to see our crocodile tears. One woman who almost always wept whenever she made some observation was described by Dr. Welch as being \u201ctoo damned damp.\u201d</p><p>Whenever we called Mrs. Welch our teacher, she said:</p><p>No. Do not call me \u2018teacher.\u2019 Mr. Gurdjieff was a teacher. We are all in the same boat. Those who have been working longer may have experienced more, and so may be able to act as a guide for those with less experience, but we are not teachers.</p><p>A number of us who had been in the Work long enough to begin to take on minor leadership roles as team leaders were invited to the <a href=\"http://www.gurdjieff.org/foundation.htm\">Gurdjieff Foundation</a>\u2019s country house in Armonk, New York. There was a large number of people there who had just recently entered the Work. In his introduction on the morning of the first day, <a href=\"http://www.gurdjieff.org/pentland.htm\">Lord Pentland</a> said, \u201cWe have all come here because we are asleep, and wish to awaken.\u201d I remember thinking at the time that the head of the Work in New York should not be telling all these new people that he also is asleep! However, he was expressing the same idea that Mrs. Welch had brought to us.</p><p>Dr. Welch said that the Work was not intended to create angels, but real human beings. We needed to see all sides of our being. In my very first meeting with Mrs. Welch, one of the other newcomers said that when she was singing in her church choir, she sometimes saw angels. Mrs. Welch said, \u201cYou also have to see the devils.\u201d</p><p>On another occasion she said:  </p><p>We are not interested in psychic phenomena, though many of us have experienced them. We are not interested merely in the experience of beautiful emotional fireworks. Our effort is in the direction of trying to <i>be</i>. Work on myself has to do with the relation of inner and outer. Sometimes one goes so deeply inside that one forgets the outer. My work is related to both. Our aim is not to dwell in Nirvana. It is to live and work in life.</p><p>After I had been part of her group for a few years, I remember telling Mrs. Welch that I was no longer afraid of her. She said only the word, \u201cOh,\u201d but her tone was such that I quickly reconsidered my remark! In the early years, she often took us to task. She said later that it was necessary to test people, before giving them responsibility. She encouraged us to question her, not to accept what she said without verifying for ourselves. After many years, she began to let us make our own mistakes, and trusted us to learn from them. There was never any sentimentality, but there was an undercurrent that we came to recognize, in part, as love. She sometimes said, \u201cLove never faileth.\u201d She used this word rarely, and we could sense that it was full of many levels of meaning that were far above what we usually meant whenever we used the word. She gave us the impression that love was the highest energy of all\u2014that all of us, and all of the created world sprang from this source.</p><p>She often encouraged us to work whole-heartedly, emphasizing the importance of compassion. Nevertheless, she did not disparage the mind, but rather encouraged us to give our \u201cbest thought\u201d to the ideas of the Gurdjieff teaching. One of Gurdjieff\u2019s central ideas is \u201cbeing-Partkdolg-duty,\u201d that is to say, \u201cconscious-labours and intentional sufferings.\u201d One summer at Armonk, in an evening discussion, she asked me to say how I understood the idea of conscious labour. I felt it was too easy to say simply, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014even though this would be the most accurate response\u2014so I offered an answer which came from I know not where. Mrs. Welch did not question my comment. Instead, she went on to ask, \u201cWhat is intentional suffering?\u201d Before I could answer, Dr. Welch said, \u201cYou\u2019d better quit while you\u2019re ahead!\u201d I\u00a0did.</p><p>I recall on another occasion speaking to Dr. Welch about the ideas. Trying to make the point that what I was speaking about was not my own experience, I said, \u201cOf course these ideas are only theoretical.\u201d Dr. Welch quickly stopped me in my tracks. \u201cIt is <i>you</i> who are theoretical. The ideas are real.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Welch was the chief editor of the \u201c<i>Guide and Index to G.\u00a0I. Gurdjieff\u2019s</i> <a href=\"http://www.gurdjieff.org/all.htm\"><i>All and Everything</i></a>.\u201d Those of us who worked with her on this project found that it became a central vehicle for our work. In her preface to this book, she wrote:</p><p>Gurdjieff speaks to the whole of a man at once, and we are unaccustomed to that call. This guide and index to <i>All and Everything</i> is the effort of a small group of people to move towards meeting this demand\u2026 We began with the realization that the meaning of Gurdjieff\u2019s book will not open to conceptual attack, but requires thought and feeling of quite another kind... We discovered that one word would become a thread to the whole teaching as it wove through explanations, parables and humorous anecdotes attaching to itself more and more clusters of meaning. One of us would declare that the clue to the book was the word \u2018being\u2019; another pursued \u2018conscience\u2019 and a third, Mullah Nassr Eddin, who sometimes appeared to all of us as the key to the character of Beelzebub himself.</p><p>She also wrote the script of a musical play based on the legend of <i>The Juggler of Notre Dame.</i>1 It was performed under that title in Toronto, and under the title of <i>The Clown of God</i> 2 in Halifax. A poster from the 1976 production in Toronto says, in part, \u201cSpend a magical four hours in the Middle Ages. Wander and shop among the craft-laden stalls of a medieval street market and sample the authentic fare of the town inn. Mingle with minstrels, monks and mummers as the miracle of <i>The Juggler of Notre Dame</i> unfolds around you.\u201d</p><p>Most of us from Mrs. Welch\u2019s groups in New York, Halifax, and Toronto took part. We produced the craft goods, cooked the food, built the sets, made the costumes, learned music, practiced juggling and tumbling, and learned our lines. In both Halifax and Toronto, we worked almost around the clock for several days leading up to, during and after the performance. Mrs. Welch always insisted that we leave any place in better condition than it had been when we arrived; so actors and musicians and all, we finished with brooms, and dust cloths and mops in our hands after the crowds had dispersed. When we sometimes hinted that there was not enough time in our busy lives for all the demands of the group activities, she would remind us that one always seemed to be able to find time for a love affair\u2026</p><p>Although the play was a great \u201csuccess,\u201d it was for all of us, primarily, a vehicle for the Work. The emphasis was not on the destination, but on the journey. Sometimes it did feel like a love affair\u2026 sometimes!</p><p>It was during these times of great intensity of Work that she passed on special material that we needed. She understood that only in these conditions of Work would it be possible for us to take in such material.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>There is something we need to learn about effort: effort is not strain. Maybe I could realize this if my relaxation were deeper. I wish there were a word other than \u2018relaxation.\u2019 The closest I can come to is \u2018letting go\u2019 of the ego; so that I can touch another layer, a much truer one. Our search is not for miraculous results\u2014not to achieve a result, but to learn a process.</p><p>There is a struggle between my wish to gather my attention and my body\u2019s habit of going on with its associations. I cannot fight directly, but I can draw my attention back to my work.</p><p>When touching a deeper level, I do not try to do, I watch. There is nothing I can do, I can only try to be. \u2018I am here,\u2019 very quietly alert. I try to follow this. It moves in a very quiet inner way, something is touched. It takes place, it has come.</p><p>Although she was generous in providing us with clues that would help us in our struggles, she understood that we had to do the work ourselves, and also that there was no point in providing us with a direction until we had come to that point in our journey where a particular direction was needed, and where we were asking for help. Sometimes in a meeting, she would say, after someone asked a question, \u201cAh! I\u00a0have been waiting a long time for this question.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>What is this combination of \u2018I\u2019s\u2019 which inhabit me? There are many of them. One is a bore, one tries to impress, one has profound opinions\u2014but underneath, something knows all this is a lie. We have to recognize as a fact that we are put into motion by whatever, or whoever, presses the button. We are continually the prey of influences. This is the human situation. Influences impinge upon me and my organism reacts. My reactions are always passive, but if there is something active in me to meet them, I have a chance. Ordinarily, I am attacked by a thousand \u2018I\u2019s.\u2019 When I try even just to pick up this cup with intention, it is almost as if the thousand \u2018I\u2019s\u2019 are reduced to two\u2014yes, and no. The effort to undertake something intentionally is an enormous help.</p><p>Where is my centre of gravity? It shifts, now here, now there, but it is not related to the central fact of my existence. I need to find that relationship. I need to find ways of returning to it so that it circulates to all my functioning parts. What I wish for is my essential root\u2014to be living in myself and related to the whole of me.</p><p>There is a real difference between knowing and believing. This Work is not based on believing, but on working toward being open to what is higher. The higher possibilities are already in us, waiting, but we have not found the connection.</p><p>On one occasion Dr. and Mrs. Welch were unable to come to a period of intensive work in Halifax. For years they had been there every summer with their two Canadian groups from Halifax and Toronto, plus several people from their groups in New York. This was the first time they were not able to come. In fact they were never to come to either Toronto or Halifax after this because of the state of Mrs. Welch\u2019s health. Several of us were in communication with Dr. Welch by phone during this Work period. Once I told him that we felt they were there with us. On impulse, I then asked facetiously, if he and Mrs. Welch felt that all of us at the Work period in Halifax were with them in their apartment in New York! His serious answer took me by surprise. \u201cYes\u201d he said, \u201cMuch has been deposited in both directions.\u201d Over the years since then, many of us have felt that this is truly so, and hence although they are no longer able to advise us directly, what they have deposited in us is still there for us to call upon.</p><p>On that same occasion, in response to a question concerning the necessity for group work, Dr. Welch said something that has since become an aphorism for us: \u201cThe Work is my independent participation in an interdependent process.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Welch said that Dr. Welch had a long-lasting love affair with the English language. As he spoke, he seemed to be searching for just the right word, the exactly turned phrase. What he said was often alive, and fresh, and memorable. In contrast, although I might be expressing the same ideas, I usually felt my words were careless cliches, and I aspired to speak as he did.</p><p>Mrs. Welch also loved language, and seemed to have the kind of mind that retained everything she read. She often quoted poetry, psalms, and passages from literature. One of her favourite poems was \u201cGod\u2019s Grandeur\u201d by Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u20131889):</p><p>The world is charged with the grandeur of God.</p><p>It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;<br/>It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil</p><p>Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?<br/>Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;</p><p>And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;<br/>And wears man\u2019s smudge and shares man\u2019s smell: the soil</p><p>Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.</p><p>And for all this, nature is never spent;</p><p>There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;</p><p>And though the last lights off the black West went</p><p>Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs\u2014</p><p>Because the Holy Ghost over the bent</p><p>World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.</p><p>She said:</p><p>Why is it that when I look at my daily life, I almost never see that it is extraordinary; that I have a life and that I am living in an extraordinary body. Being alive is a miracle, and I am unaware of it most of the time.</p><p>Later she said:</p><p>Shakespeare\u2019s description of the seven ages of man provides a good picture of the descending octave of the physical body. The body will die\u2026 What in us can continue?</p><p>She often taught us without words. The care she took in laying the table for a meal affected us, and we would find ourselves later taking the same care when sweeping a floor, or washing dishes. When she watched us as we worked on crafts, or cooking, or construction, it sometimes seemed that she lent us her attention. Seeing that it was possible to work in that way, with care, helped us later to find that quality on our own. She said:</p><p>There is a direct relationship between care and the attention I give. I see that when I care very much, I gain attention.</p><p>She sometimes told us what she called \u201csecrets,\u201d and I remember thinking, \u201cSurely, if she tells us, they will no longer be secrets.\u201d Later, I saw that what she told us was a secret, and it might take a long time before we understood what she had said.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>If I could really remember myself, much of me would be affected. Anger would take its proper place. Unknown territory exists in me, it is real. If I try to be open to its influence, the Work works in me. Certainly with my little self I cannot change. I will start each day with preparation, opening myself to help. We cannot complain when we do not receive, because it is we who hinder.</p><p>Do not try to change. Study. When you work, something drops away of itself.</p><p>When you see anxiety, acknowledge to yourself in your own way how you are, and try not to run away, but to be in it more. Sense it more, see how you are inside, and try to see the distribution of your tensions. Then make a strong effort of relaxation, and try to come to some affirmation of yourself at the end of this.</p><p>Better one five-minute effort that is true and intense, and real, than a whole day of \u2018porridgy\u2019 dreaming that you are remembering yourself. Only that which you have earned and verified many, many times, through effort, can be yours.</p><p>One of the weekends when she was in Toronto after all the scheduled meetings and activities were over, on a Sunday evening, Mrs. Welch invited me to spend some time with her alone. It was a rare privilege. I\u00a0had been feeling disheartened, and perhaps she had noticed my state. We met just for an hour or so. Our exchange was quite light. We touched on no weighty topics that I can remember. Nevertheless, her words and her attention seemed to embrace, and penetrate, and heal.</p><p>The next morning she returned to New York, and I went off to my office. After a long and difficult day, I\u00a0was walking home and noticed that my posture was slumped; there was a frown on my face; my mind was churning over the events of the day; there was no spring in my step. Then quite miraculously, I became aware of a feeling in my chest that did not at all correspond to my outer state. It was something joyful, completely carefree, untouched and unconcerned with the petty cares of my day. The thought flashed through my mind that Mrs. Welch had deposited this something in me the night before.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>Mr. Gurdjieff brought this knowledge to us in a very direct way. It will take us a long time to assimilate. His rate was so much faster and deeper than ours. But his pupils are gradually understanding more and more\u2014trying to live his teaching. He brought us the need to understand and to search as deeply as we can\u2014never to accept too easily even our own experience, but to try to understand that the way to the source of our own energy, our own truth, is a process. We will change very much in that process, and only by trying to understand it will we begin to return to it\u2014to grow and develop in a many-sided way.</p><p>How to make an effort of attention? For a very long time, all our efforts are full of tension and strain. We need to learn gradually to let go.</p><p>Trying to divide our attention is an experiment. It is not a state of self-remembering. Self-remembering is a blended attention\u2014the attention of the real mind, the true feeling, and the cooperation of the instinctive/moving parts. There is a division between what represents \u2018I\u2019 and what represents my organism and functions. In order to study that, we try to divide our attention, but that is just one step. I am searching for something more inclusive, more whole. If I am in touch with my essential passion for truth, this helps me to call upon that effort of attention which includes thought, feeling and sensation. When for a moment that fusion takes place, I experience myself as a whole.</p><p>Begin to feel the relation between inner and outer life. It is necessary to see the reality of the inner life and have contact with it, but we must be present to both inner and outer.</p><p>In one state, we lie and are not aware of it. In another state, we lie and know it, but cannot stop. In still another state we struggle with the impulse. See how in all these states the disposition of the parts is different in us. When one is aware, one notices much sooner. It is interesting that on a higher level the quickness is such that one notices before there is any manifestation of action, thought, or emotion.</p><p>A strong state of attention is joy. One feels wholly engaged, and that is what the human heart desperately wishes.</p><p>We live within a very small emotional range. We think we are experiencing a strong emotion when we become angry, but there is a whole range of emotions that we never touch. We read of compassion, faith, hope, but these are just words to us. We don\u2019t live on that level. All of our experiments are for the purpose of making valid contacts with the higher centres, not something we experience now and then, or read about in books, but something permanent that is our own.</p><p>Less than a decade ago, we bought a country place just outside of Toronto so that we could have a place for our summer work periods. The Welches at this time were no longer coming to visit their Canadian groups. On the first day of our first period, both Dr. and Mrs. Welch asked, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d My automatic answer was that we valued these periods of intensive work. I telephoned them every day to tell them what was taking place, and to get their advice. They continued to ask me why we were having an intensive work period in Toronto. Gradually, it began to occur to me that we had no idea what we were doing. There was no doubt that Dr. and Mrs. Welch could conduct a work period, but who were we to attempt such an undertaking?</p><p>This question worked on me, mercilessly. Gradually it became painfully clear that I did not understand any of the knowledge I had accumulated over the years. I understood nothing! It was a devastating realization. I began to feel the weight of responsibility and to approach a state of despair. I felt very deeply\u2014as never before or since\u2014that I needed help. Then in the midst of this state, I felt that help came\u2014not just to me, but to all of us. I felt real gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Welch for guiding us, and goading us, and putting our feet to the fire.</p><p>Mrs. Welch told us:</p><p>The more I see my helplessness, the more I feel the need to be in touch with the source of energy. I <i>begin</i>, thinking I can <i>do</i> the Work. It takes time to see my helplessness. A real cry for help does not fail, but it has to be real at the moment, not in retrospect.</p><p>The times when we do receive something must not be underestimated. They are real. When we reach a state of deep quiet, when we touch another level of energy, it is very difficult, impossible, to move into our daily activities with that full circulation of energy. Yet it is possible to have some link with that state.</p><p>Somewhere I know that if I can be open enough, another force of a higher vibration rate can begin to enter that changes everything\u2014my understanding of my presence here, my relationship to others and to the different parts of myself. How can I help to make myself more available for this energy, more open to this energy? It does not depend solely on my wish. It is not so much that I bring an influence, but that an influence comes.</p><p>I was not able to attend Mrs. Welch\u2019s funeral. Patty Welch Llosa, Mrs. Welch\u2019s daughter, asked me if I\u00a0would write a eulogy to be read on that occasion. I wrote the following passage which represents, perhaps, the essence of this article:</p><p>Early in my life I met Mrs. Welch, and that has made all the difference.</p><p>I have often called Patty my sister and she has called me her brother because we are both children of Mrs. Welch. She had a large family, a whole tribe in fact. What is written here may therefore sound quite familiar. Many of us had the same experiences. Nevertheless each one of us felt we had a special place in her heart: that she saw <i>me</i>, knew me, cared about my potential, spoke to me. And so each of us wished to try with our best effort to follow her direction with a passion. She often quoted Orage\u2019s description: \u201cMan is in essence a passion for understanding the meaning and aim of existence.\u201d</p><p>We have been so lucky, so fortunate to have been part of her circle.</p><p>She inspired us; she called forth talents we didn\u2019t know we had; she dared to trust us with precious burdens that buckled our knees, bent our backs, and strengthened us. Big projects such as the <i>Guide and Index</i>, <i>A Journal of Our Time</i>, <i>The Juggler of Notre Dame</i> in Toronto, <i>The Clown of God</i> in Halifax, called us to super-efforts. It wasn\u2019t just the daring ideas she had. It was not even the wisdom of her words when she responded to our questions. It was her being that shone through and fed us directly. It sparkled in her eyes, it emanated from her posture, her movements, her voice, and it fed us directly\u2014without our even knowing it at the time.</p><p>We shall miss her.</p><p>At the same time I know that she has deposited in me something of her own being which is not inert. It is alive and essential.</p><p>She is our essence friend.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>1 <i>The Juggler of Notre Dame</i> is a 13th Century French legend about a young juggler\u2019s search for a special Christmas gift for the Christ Child and Madonna and the miracle that occurs when he offers his talent on Christmas Eve.</p><p>2 <i>The Clown of God</i> is the oldest known title for the legend of <i>The Juggler of Notre Dame</i>.</p><h3>Bibliography</h3><p>Welch, Louise (1905\u20131999). <i>Orage with Gurdjieff in America</i>.

        "intro": "<p>Born in Alexandropol, near the Persian frontier of Russia, of a Greek father and an Armenian mother and later tutored by the Dean of the Military Cathedral at Kars, he was brought up in an antique patriarchal world where children were put to sleep at night with the story of Gilgamesh.</p>",
        "body": "<p>GEORGE IVANOVITCH GURDJIEFF (1877\u20131949). These brackets enclose seventy-two years of a life that, in spite of all that has been written about it, is incapable of exact documentation. It is a fact that Gurdjieff died in 1949, but since he gave his age differently at different times, the date of birth given here can only be approximate. This was all part of his enigma, of the sense he gave of deliberately playing a role, or, as P.\u00a0D.\u00a0Ouspensky wrote, after their first meeting, of being a man \u201cpoorly disguised.\u201d His whole life, for the biographers, has the air of an authentic myth, in the sense of something heroic and significant but not to be apprehended except in so far as he could, by these very disguises, mediate it to the general understanding.</p><p>Born in Alexandropol, near the Persian frontier of Russia, of a Greek father and an Armenian mother and later tutored by the Dean of the Military Cathedral at Kars, he was brought up in an antique patriarchal world where children were put to sleep at night with the story of Gilgamesh. While he was still a very young man, however, Gurdjieff, true to his role, \u201cdisappeared\u201d\u2014as Odysseus must have seemed to disappear from his local world of Ithaca\u2014into that cauldron of history, tradition and ideas that we know as the Middle East. Indeed, in his second book <i>Meetings With Remarkable Men</i> he describes an even wider orbit, taking in the Gobi Desert, Mecca and Tibet, though here the reader must decide for himself whether such names stand for places or symbols\u2014they could equally well be either\u2014in his unremitting search for a \u201creal and universal knowledge.\u201d \u201cI was not alone,\u201d Ouspensky quotes him as saying. \u201cThere were all sorts of specialists among us. We called ourselves \u2018The Seekers of Truth!\u2019\u201d</p><p>It has to be inferred that by 1914 the Seekers of Truth had succeeded in their quest, for in the autumn of that year Ouspensky records his first meeting with Gurdjieff. \u201cI realised,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat I had met with a completely new system of thought surpassing all I had known before. This system threw quite a new light on psychology and explained what I could not understand before in esoteric ideas.\u201d</p><p>From this time onwards, since among his pupils there was now one taking notes, Gurdjieff\u2014though only in so far as he himself wished to be\u2014was in the eye of history. For the first two years of the First World War he elaborated his teachings to groups in Petersburg and Moscow, but with the onset of revolution, flight was inevitable. His journey with his followers through Russia to the Caucasus, then to Constantinople and at last to the West has all the elements of a modern thriller. But it is given an epic quality and extra dimension by the fact that Gurdjieff used the hardships and dangers\u2014always for him the true stuff of existence\u2014to exemplify his teaching and required of his pupils that they should escape not merely with their lives but with their Life. It was not until 1922 that he succeeded in his aim of bringing to the West what he had found in the East by establishing his pilgrim band at the Ch\u00e2teau du Prieur\u00e9, near Fontainebleau, where he founded his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man.</p><p>What was the source of his teaching? True to his role, Gurdjieff never openly disclosed it. By examining his writings and the numerous commentaries upon them it might be possible to discover parallels in various traditions\u2014Tantric Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism, Greek Orthodoxy\u2014possible, but hardly profitable. For the fundamental features of his method cannot be traced to any one source. Ouspensky quotes him as admitting, \u201cI will say that, if you like, this is esoteric Christianity.\u201d There seems no reason to reject this when one remembers that Christianity, as Gurdjieff knew it, was the heir of the ages and must have drawn to itself elements from very early pre-Christian traditions, Hittite, Assyrian, Phrygian, Persian; and there is nothing so explosive as old ideas restated in contemporary terms as the Western world was to discover when Gurdjieff burst upon it. His impact was tremendous. It was clear that he had come not to bring peace but a special kind of inner warfare and that his mission in life was to destroy men\u2019s complacency and make them aware of their limitations. Only by such means, by what he called \u201cconscious labours and intentional sufferings,\u201d was it possible to bring about their inner development. The Work, as his method came to be called, had, as it very soon appeared, been only too accurately named. Writers, artists, men from all kinds of professions\u2014among them Thomas de\u00a0Hartmann, Russian composer, A.\u00a0R.\u00a0Orage, editor of <i>The New Age</i> and later one of the subtlest commentators of Gurdjieff\u2019s writings, Rowland Kenney of <i>The Herald,</i> Dr. Maurice Nicoll, Jane Heap of <i>The Little Review</i>\u2014found themselves digging wells, chopping down trees and breaking stones by day, while at night they were required to take part in the sacred dances, or \u201cMovements,\u201d which were an integral part of the teaching, or assisting at one of Gurdjieff\u2019s great feasts where, under the influence of good food, vodka and the watchful eye of the Master, opportunities were provided, for those who had the courage, to come face to face with themselves. The hardiest among them, those who could rise to the level of \u201cbeing serious,\u201d were allowed to transmit something of the teaching to newer pupils.</p><p>By 1924 the Work was sufficiently well established for Gurdjieff to set out on the first of his trips to the United States where in January, in New York, a group of forty pupils gave a series of demonstrations of his Movements. Two thirds of these evenings were devoted to the sacred dances and the last third to what was described as \u201cTrick, Semi-Trick and Real Supernatural Phenomena.\u201d The audience was invited to distinguish between them and reminded that \u201cthe study of the first two was held to be indispensable to the study of the third, since to understand the last a perfectly impartial attitude and a judgment not burdened by pre-established beliefs were necessary.\u201d It is clear from Gurdjieff\u2019s writings that hypnotism, mesmerism and various arcane methods of expanding consciousness must have played a large part in the studies of the Seekers of Truth. None of these processes, however, is to be thought of as having any bearing on what is called Black Magic, which, according to Gurdjieff, \u201chas always one definite characteristic. It is the tendency to use people for some, even the best of aims, without their knowledge and understanding, either by producing in them faith and infatuation or by acting upon them through fear. There is, in fact, neither red, green nor yellow magic. There is \u2018doing.\u2019 Only \u2018doing\u2019 is magic.\u201d Properly to realise the scale of what Gurdjieff meant by magic, one has to remember his continually repeated aphorism, \u201cOnly he who can <i>be</i> can do,\u201d and its corollary that, lacking this fundamental verb, nothing is \u2018done,\u2019 things simply \u2018happen.\u2019</p><p>The American tour brought a new influx of pupils to the Prieur\u00e9 and, as usual, Gurdjieff, by deliberate indirection, set them to find directions out. \u201cThe teaching,\u201d writes one, \u201cwas given in fragments\u2014often in unexpected ways\u2014and we had to learn to put the pieces together and connect them up through our observations and experiences.\u201d However, the year 1924 was to prove a landmark for the teaching. It was in the late summer that Gurdjieff, slowly reassembling his forces after a near-fatal motor car accident, himself began during convalescence to put together in the form of a book those separated fragments. Work activities were reduced. Gurdjieff, while sustaining those pupils who remained, wrote incessantly, whether at Fontainebleau, or on his frequent motoring trips or seated at a table in the Caf\u00e9 de\u00a0la Paix in Paris where he had long been a familiar figure. <i>All and Everything</i> the book is called, not inaccurately, since it sets out to cover every aspect of the life of man. Into this vast allegory of <i>Beelzebub\u2019s Tales to His Grandson,</i> top-heavy from its sheer weight of argument and at the same time soaring off into space, like a great, lumbering flying cathedral, Gurdjieff gathered the fundamentals of his teaching. Man, we are told, has an unique place and function in the cosmological scheme and enters into obligation by the fact of being born. The awareness of all this is not, however, a gift of Nature, neither are Individuality, Consciousness, Free Will and an Immortal Soul\u2014these attributes, which man mistakenly believes he already possesses, have to be acquired by his own special efforts. Above all, the book repeatedly insists that man is asleep. It is only at the moment when he awakens, not merely to consciousness but to conscience\u2014to Gurdjieff the words were, in fact, synonymous\u2014that his true evolution can begin.</p><p>The manuscript, constantly revised, now became the focal point of the teaching, not only in France but in New York during his two next American trips, in 1929 and 1933. But in the latter year, with the sale of the Prieur\u00e9, Gurdjieff\u2019s life enters another phase. After enjoying for nine years a local habitation and a celebrated name, he appears, clearly for reasons of his own\u2014for Gurdjieff never stood still, he was always growing, always experimenting, always searching\u2014to retire into the shadows. \u201cHe is no longer teaching,\u201d said his older pupils when new people wanted to make direct contact with him. But one of his pet tenets was that the Work was not designed to discover something new but to recover that which is lost. An intrepid few, a handful of Homers attempting to chart the course of Odysseus, set out to do just that. If he accepted them, they were put into small intimate groups, each member depending upon the others, like mountain climbers upon a rope, and no group had any connection with the others. This was in keeping with Gurdjieff\u2019s earlier work in Moscow when Ouspensky quotes him as saying that he never mixed groups but occupied each with a different work \u201caccording to the state of their preparation and their powers.\u201d When one remembers that Gurdjieff\u2019s teaching was essentially intimate and personal, his insistence that by the very nature of the Work he could not have many pupils appears valid and inevitable. The published reminiscences of various members of these small groups bear witness to the fact that he was, indeed, teaching in the thirties, but quietly, as though it were a question of <i>reculer pour mieux sauter,</i>1 And as usual he was careful not to let his right hand know what his left was doing. Those who knew the Teacher could gather only by rumour and hearsay that there were other Gurdjieff\u2019s\u2014the healer of psychic illnesses, the one who could cure alcoholism, Gurdjieff the business man, and the Gurdjieff known as \u201cMonsieur Bonbon,\u201d an old eccentric gentleman whose sole mission in life, it appeared, was to dispense candy to local cronies and children. None of the latter could have guessed when, in May 1939, \u201cMonsieur Bonbon\u201d could not be found, that it was because somebody called \u201cMister Gurdjieff\u201d had once again gone to America, a country he held in affectionate regard because of its \u201cbrotherliness.\u201d On his return to Paris war was at hand and with the outbreak of hostilities Gurdjieff disappeared from the sight of all but his French pupils until the Liberation. It is said that he sustained himself through those lean years by putting about the rumour that he was heir to a Texas oil well. Nobody was more surprised than the French shopkeepers to find, when his British and American pupils streamed back and paid the bills, that the story was essentially true.</p><p>The year 1946 marked the beginning of the last phase of his teaching, a period that for those who had known him earlier was richer than any that had gone before. For a little over three years new adherents and old pupils bringing their own pupils and children, flocked to his small crowded room to listen to a reading of one of his manuscripts<i>\u2014All and Everything, Meetings With Remarkable Men, Life Is Real Only When I Am\u2014</i>to hear him play on his small hand accordion the music he had composed for the different chapters, or to sit at his table and receive the bounty of his teaching in whatever form it might be given. \u201cIf take, then take!\u201d was one of his favourite aphorisms\u2014no sipping, no trifling\u2014and for many the special nourishment that was offered in addition to the delicious edibles was indigestible, hard to stomach. The exotic flavours and the vodka in which the famous \u201cToasts to the Idiots\u201d were drunk (Gr.\u00a0<i>idiotes,</i> private person, that which in myself I am) did not make things easier. But easiness was not the aim. The patriarchal host, massive of presence, radiating a serene power at once formidable and reassuring, dispensed this \u201cfood\u201d in various ways, always unexpected; sometimes in thunderclaps of rage, sometimes telling a story that only one of all the table would know was meant for himself, sometimes merely by look or gesture thrusting home the truth. Masks were stripped off mercilessly. Beneath the exacting benevolence of his gaze everyone was naked. But occasionally, for those who could face their situation Gurdjieff, always fleetingly, would let his own mask fall. It was possible then to see that behind the apparent mercilessness stood sorrow and compassion. At such moments his \u201chumanity-ness\u201d\u2014a key word in his odd English vocabulary\u2014would radiantly declare itself. If his aim was to teach men how to rise to the possibility of saying \u201cI am,\u201d he never forgot that \u201cThou art\u201d and \u201cHe is\u201d complete the conjugation.</p><p>In addition to all this energy of work in his own apartment, Gurdjieff now instituted at the Salle Pleyel daily practices of the Movements, the sacred dances that were so essential a part of his teaching. It was not only in Paris, however, that the Work year by year so vigourously progressed. There were groups already in England and the United States and others were now established in Holland, Sweden, Germany and South America. And in New York, in 1949, on January 13th, his name day, Gurdjieff, on what was to be his last trip to America, announced that he was now ready to publish <i>All and Everything.</i> At the same time, those English disciples who, after Ouspensky\u2019s death in 1947, had joined the Paris groups, arranged for the publication of <i>In Search of the Miraculous,</i> Ouspensky\u2019s long-withheld account of his early years with Gurdjieff. These two books, the first giving to the second an added dimension and the second clarifying the first, opened up the teaching. Gurdjieff now belonged to the world for the brief time that was left him. His health was faltering, but such was his powerhouse of inner strength that few could be brought to believe it. Throughout the summer, after his return from New York, the Work went on with added intensity. Gurdjieff, while serenely putting his own house in order, used every moment as a moment of teaching and each aspect of his fading strength as a reminding factor for his pupils that \u201cman must live till he dies.\u201d To \u201clive\u201d in Gurdjieff\u2019s sense, was consciously to labour and voluntarily to suffer. This he himself did, with constancy and deliberation, until the 29th of October, 1949.</p><p>Since his death his work has been continued by his chosen pupils and groups are to be found everywhere in the Western world. The Movements have been accurately documented in a series of films; his second book, <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men,</i> has been published and the third is in preparation.2 The siftings of time are likely to prove that these records are his proper monument. In them the man and his myth are one. Those who seek him there may repeatedly discern a single, authentic anonymous footprint. It seems a fitting recognition of his role that Gurdjieff\u2019s grave in Avon, near Fontainebleau, is bare of any name.</p><h3>Notes</h3><ol><li>Retreat in order to advance.
